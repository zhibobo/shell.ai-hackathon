This is our greedy solution.

Assume the best Depot locations give the best Refinery locations
Assume we should always fill Depot to minimize Underutilization cost

As there is limited information for forecasting biomass, an average is used to forecast.

Total forecasted biomass is 341k. 
Accounting for fluctuations of 5%, 324k & 359k 
Minimum biomass to collect (constraints is 80%), 259k & 286k. 
Safe to collect more than 286k < 300k = 15 depots (multiples of 20k)

Again, to minimize Underutilization, 3 refineries are used.

For depots, we calculate the depot cheapest to fill up with the surrounding biomass, 
where cost is calculated by biomass value multiplied by distance. We then select that depot 
and fill up it up with the surrounding biomass. We remove the biomass from the grid, and 
find the cheapest depot to fill up again. By repeating this process, we find the 15 
cheapest depots that can minimize cost.

For refinaries, our approach is the same as depots. We calculate the refinery that is the 
cheapest to fill up with the surrounding depots, where cost is calculated by depot value 
multiplied by distance. We then select that depot and fill up it up with the surrounding 
pellets. We remove the pellets from the grid, and find the cheapest refinery to fill up again. 
By repeating this process, we find the 3 cheapest refinaries that can minimize cost.
